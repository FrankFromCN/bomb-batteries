A comprehensive battery sales website with 4 interconnected pages showcasing the "Bomb Batteries" brand. The site includes interactive tools, security awareness content, and professional contact forms.

## Debugging Methodology

### 1. Development Approach
- **Modular JavaScript Structure**: Separated concerns into distinct modules (Navigation, Calculator, Security, ContactForm)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactivity
- **Error Boundaries**: Each module wrapped in error handling to prevent cascading failures

### 2. Testing Strategy
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verified on various screen sizes (320px to 1920px)
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all validation scenarios
- **Calculator Accuracy**: Mathematical operations verified with manual calculations
