Project 1: Individual Case Project
(15 marks)
Project Overview
Create a themed website with at least 4 pages on a topic of your choice (e.g., environmental sustainability, hobby showcase, educational resource). This integrated project combines requirements from Chapters 1-7 into a cohesive application with these core components:

Interactive tools using JavaScript calculations and logic
Educational content about web security
Advanced form handling with validation and dynamic data
Debugging documentation

All pages must share consistent navigation and pass HTML/CSS validation.
Required Pages (Minimum)
1. Homepage (Content Hub)

Introduce your theme with text/images
Implement responsive navigation (expandable for future pages)
Chapter 1 Requirement:
Validate markup using W3C Validator
Ensure semantic HTML5 structure



2. Interactive Calculator Page

Create a practical tool related to your theme:
Examples:
Carbon footprint estimator (environment theme)
Material cost calculator (DIY hobby)
Recipe converter (food blog)




Technical Requirements:
Chapter 2: Function processing user inputs with arithmetic operators
Chapter 3: Conditional logic (if/else or switch) generating customized output messages



3. Web Security Awareness Page

Educate users about browser data exposure and safe practices
Technical Requirements:
Chapter 5: Display 6+ browser properties
Include 3+ external safety resources with summaries



4. Enhanced Contact/Feedback Page

Build a professional form with advanced validation
Technical Requirements:
Chapter 3: 3+ field types (e.g., email, dropdown, checkboxes) with validation
Chapter 7: Checkbox group (1+ options) managed in array/object
Chapter 4: Error handling with try/catch blocks



Theme Ideas

Environmental: Solar energy calculator + sustainability resources
Educational: STEM learning tools + study tips
Creative Portfolio: Art project cost estimator + commission form
Community Service: Volunteer sign-up + impact calculator
Health/Fitness: Calorie tracker + workout planner

Deliverables Checklist

About STEM
Why STEM Matters
Global Impact
Drives innovation in medicine, renewable energy, and AI.
Career Opportunities

75% of fastest-growing jobs require STEM skills (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Equity: Encourages diversity in traditionally underrepresented fields (e.g., women in tech).

STEM vs. STEAM

STEAM adds Arts (e.g., design, creativity) to STEM.
Example: Your website's user interface (UI) requires artistic design (A) alongside coding (T/E/M).

Simple Breakdown of How to Apply STEM When Developing a Website
S - Science

Use logic, research, and understanding of users and systems.
Study user behavior (UX research).
Analyze how people interact with similar websites.
Understand performance, load times, and browser behaviors.
Use A/B testing to evaluate what works best.
Example: Test two layouts to see which one gets more clicks.

T - Technology

Apply tools, languages, and platforms to build the website.
Use HTML/CSS for layout and design.
Use JavaScript for interactivity.
Use GitHub for version control.
Example: Build a dynamic contact form using JavaScript and host it on GitHub Pages.

E - Engineering

Design and build the structure of the site efficiently.
Plan the site's architecture (pages, components, navigation).
Optimize for responsiveness (mobile/desktop).
Example: Structure a site using components and reusable code blocks in React.

M - Math

Use math for layout, performance, and logic:
e.g., Use math in animations, percentages, or aspect ratios.
Optimize algorithms (like sorting search results or filtering data).
Analyze traffic data (e.g., Google Analytics).


Example: Use percentages and ratios to make the layout adapt to screen size.

In Summary - Using STEM to Build a Website:

Science: Research users and tech designs.
Technology: Use tools and languages to build it.
Engineering: Structure and optimize the website.
Math: Apply logic and data to design and improve.
